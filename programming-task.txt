Write a Python program. It should take an argument --output which will
be a CSV file it will write to. It should take an argument --sources which is
a directory -- it should recursively traverse every subdirectory of it looking
for files that end with .txt

When it finds one, it should count the words in it. It will be a small
file. There will also be a file in the same directory with the same
name but a .timing filename extension. Raise an error if there is not.

There will be junk at the beginning of the file, but towards the end of the .timing file it will look like this:

total duration:       2m22.854837895s
load duration:        1.93574657s
prompt eval count:    9 token(s)
prompt eval duration: 359ms
prompt eval rate:     25.07 tokens/s
eval count:           1025 token(s)
eval duration:        2m20.559s
eval rate:            7.29 tokens/s

Each of these can be extracted out with regexes, knowing that "total duration" may not be at the beginning of the line. We will want the contents after the colon (strip whitespace).

It should output a record in the CSV file with columns:
 - the full path of the .txt file
 - the total duration
 - the load duration
 - the prompt eval count
 - the prompt eval duration
 - the prompt eval rate
 - the eval count
 - the eval duration
 - the eval rate
