Write a Python program. It should take an argument --output which will
be a CSV file it will write to. It should take an argument --sources which is
a directory -- it should recursively traverse every subdirectory of it looking
for files that end with .txt . It should ignore files named question.txt for now.

When it finds one with another name, it should count the words in it. It will
be a small file. There will also be a file in the same directory with the same 
name but a .timing filename extension. It's the output from /usr/bin/time, e.g. like this:

0.02user 0.01system 2:29.70elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 27136maxresident)k
344inputs+0outputs (4major+3152minor)pagefaults 0swaps

We want to get the time before "elapsed" (e.g. 2:29.70) which is minutes:seconds.centiseconds. 
It might also be hours:minutes:seconds.  Turn that time into a float of seconds (e.g. 149.70).

Then look for a file called question.txt in the same directory as the .txt and .timing
files. This file should exist, raise an error if it doesn't. Read it and calculate
the md5 checksum.

It should output a record in the CSV file with columns:
 - the full path of the .txt file
 - the word count
 - the elapsed time in seconds
 - the md5 checksum
