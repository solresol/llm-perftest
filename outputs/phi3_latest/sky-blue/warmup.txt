The sky appears predominantly blue to us on a clear day due to Rayleigh scattering. This phenomenon occurs when molecules and small particles in Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight, which contains all colors of light within it. When this scattered light interacts with the atmospherinis, molecules nearer to earth receive shorter wavelengths – blue being around 450-495 nanometers - more frequently than longer wavelengths like red and yellow due to their smaller size compared to other particles in the air. As a result, our eyes perceive the sky as having a bluish color during daylight hours when the sun is high because that’s where we are looking from on Earth's surface; at dawn or dusk (or around sunrise and sunset), reds, yellows, and oranges become more prevalent in our view of the sky as blue light has been scattered out.
