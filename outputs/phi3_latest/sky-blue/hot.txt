The color of the sky appears to be blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight enters Earth'in atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and small particles that are suspended in air. Sunlight consists of different colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) which have various wavelengths. When light hits these atmospheric particles, the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more than other colors due to their smaller size relative to the wavelength of visible light. However, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet light; plus, some of the short-wavelength sunlight gets absorbed by the ozone layer which protects us from ultraviolet radiation before it reaches Earth's surface. Therefore, when we look at the sky away from the Sun (during daytime), it appears mostly blue to us due to this scattering process dominated by shorter wavelength light being redirected across much of the visible spectrum in all directions but most visibly seen as a uniform blue hue.
