The color of the sky appears blue because of a process called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of different colors, each with its own wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered more effectively by the molecules in the air than other colors. This causes the blue light to be dispersed across the sky, making it appear blue to an observer on the ground. This effect is most pronounced when the sun is high in the sky and is less noticeable during sunrise or sunset when the light has to pass through more of the atmosphere.
