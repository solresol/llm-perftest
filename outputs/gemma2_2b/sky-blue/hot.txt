The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Sunlight:** The sun emits white light, which is made up of all the colors of the rainbow (visible spectrum).

**2. Earth's atmosphere:** When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of nitrogen and oxygen.

**3. Scattering:** These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light.  This causes the sun's white light to scatter in all directions. 
   * **Blue light scatters most effectively:** Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors in the spectrum. As it scatters, it travels in many different directions and reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky.

**4. Our Perception:**  Because blue light scatters so much, we see the sky as predominantly blue. 

**Why not violet?** 
While violet light has an even shorter wavelength than blue light, our atmosphere is less efficient at scattering violet light.  This means our eyes receive less violet light overall and perceive a slightly bluer sky.


**Other Factors:** The color of the sky can also change depending on:

* **Time of day:** At sunrise and sunset, the sunlight travels through more of Earth's atmosphere, which causes longer wavelengths (red and orange) to dominate the sky while blue is scattered away. 
* **Clouds and pollution:** Clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere can block or scatter light differently, making them appear white or gray.  Pollutants like smoke can also absorb some light, further changing the color of the sky.
