A classic question that has fascinated humans for centuries! The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.

Here's what happens:

1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it consists of all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).
2. **Light encounters tiny molecules**: The light hits tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), which are present in the atmosphere.
3. **Scattering occurs**: These small molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.
4. **Blue light dominates**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky.
5. **Our eyes perceive blue**: When we look up at the sky, we see the blue light that has been scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere.

There are a few other factors that contribute to the color of the sky:

* **Dust and pollution**: Tiny particles in the air can scatter light and give the sky a more hazy or grayish appearance.
* **Water vapor**: Water molecules in the air can also scatter light, which is why the sky often appears more blue on dry days.
* **Time of day**: The color of the sky changes throughout the day due to the angle of the sun. During sunrise and sunset, the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere, scattering off more particles and taking on a reddish hue.

In summary, the sky appears blue because of the way that light interacts with the tiny molecules in our atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths (like blue) more than longer wavelengths (like red).
